2,23/4/2025 17:22,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",Two-handed rotation behaviour,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"More advance control could be implemented such as adding a feature when using 2 hands simultaneously to move the globe’s position while at the same time rotating with both hands. For both rotation and scaling behaviour its a bit hard to do when this features are on since sometimes it does scaling when I want to rotate. If there is a feature when we could touch the globe directly to control its position or rotation, it would be more interact-able and fun."

5,25/4/2025 20:04,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",One-handed rotation behaviour,"Maintain globe position: The position of the globe remains unchanged, irrespective of size adjustments",In this combination I prefer to choose one-handed rotation because it’s more convinient when combined with positioning.
6,26/4/2025 10:02,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,One-handed rotation behaviour,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"The combination of one-handed rotation and scaling gesture is better, because its easier to hold for a few seconds rather than changing the direction when using both hands. Sometimes, even by changing direction, the gesture is still treated as scaling."
7,26/4/2025 11:17,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",No preference,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"I want to highlight rotation behaviour, I think both one-handed and two-handed work, it depends on the use case. For example, when the orientation is difficult, I prefer two-handed, when its just simpler rotation, I would prefer one-handle."
8,30/4/2025 16:47,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,Two-handed rotation behaviour,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"I prefer static, two handed and for scaling i prefer maintain distance in this combined gesture. I think for adaptive, it should be following our position in all axes not only y axis."
9,30/4/2025 18:04,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,Two-handed rotation behaviour,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,For combined gestures i would prefer two handed for rotation. All preference remain the same.
10,1/5/2025 18:19,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",No preference,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"I prefer adaptive for positioning, no preference for rotation, and maintain distance for scaling. For rotation, I choose it because it depends on the situation based on the case. "
11,2/5/2025 21:04,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,No preference,No preference,"My preferences remains the same. One handed rotation feels better but for combined gesture, yet I would prefer two handed rotation if it is with palms."
12,6/5/2025 9:53,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",No preference,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"1. It is better to have different gestures for all techniques. Because the gestures are conflicted and it will confuse people when they try to use one specific technique. For example: I want to rotate the globe with one pinch and the globe tends to move instead of rotating or if i want to rotate with two pinch it opt out to zoom.
2. One possible suggestion is implementing one pinch to move, 2 pinches to scale, and using palm to rotate (like rorating a door knob).
3. Maybe look into DPI or sensitivity for future research"

1,23/4/2025 15:50,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,"I prefer the static orientation as it makes me feel more enjoyable and easy to move it.  However, in relation to moving the globe, I think, gaze is effective enough but the pinch gesture must be changed into other gestures such as thumb movement."
2,23/4/2025 16:56,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.","Static orientation give me a little bit of nausea. And regarding the control, the x and y axis gesture is easy to control, but for both negative and positive z-axis is a bit hard to do since its depends on my hand’s position and hand’s length."
3,24/4/2025 11:27,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,"Static is more intuitove because it only display 1 type of direction to control than adaptive. In order to rotate the globe, i suggest to introduce one more gesture where we can pinch and rotate finger at the same time. "
4,25/4/2025 11:42,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,"I like it when it static it is more dynamic and realistic like a globe should be, to move the globe I think it would be better if we can pinch and throw the globe to the designated positions. or maybe we can move the globe by the palm of our hands."
5,25/4/2025 19:30,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",It’s easier to see the same side and of the earth. It will be better if I can grab it like a real globe
6,26/4/2025 9:42,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.," I prefer the static one because it more realistic, more natural.its more convenient to observe, and it feels like we use real globe. I feel the gaze and pinch method is better that’s directly touch, it is also less prone to errors."
7,26/4/2025 10:41,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",I prefer the adaptive orientation one because it remains focused and detailed.
8,30/4/2025 16:10,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,The static one feels more real like physical globe.  It would be convinient if there is a frame like a physical globe where we can move the globe around with that.
9,30/4/2025 17:44,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,I prefer the static one because its more intuitive
10,1/5/2025 17:47,"Adaptive orientation: The globe rotates as it moves, so I always see the same side of the Earth.",I prefer adaptive one because its easier to observe the surface. 
11,2/5/2025 20:45,Static orientation: The globe's orientation remains fixed while it moves.,I prefer static because its easier to focus on the globe and less confusing
12,6/5/2025 9:16,I have no preference,"1. It depends on the situation, if the situation doesn’t require me to actually show the globe to other people, I wouldn’t mind if it doesn’t move. But, if it requires me to show other people (live presentation), I would want it to adaptively look towards me every time. Because if not I need to always adjust the orientation.
2. The DPI needs to be adaptive, my preference is to pinch the globe and move it towards the destination. But, it always falls shorter than it should have been.
3. I had difficulty in selecting the main globe when it is obstructed by the target globe. This is due to the need to repinch when my hand is out of space. "

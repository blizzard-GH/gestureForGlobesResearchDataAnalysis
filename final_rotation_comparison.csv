1,23/4/2025 16:04,One-handed rotation gesture,"I feel more convenient to use one-handed rotation gesture because it is less confusing compared to two-handed rotation gesture, where I had a bit more difficulties in balancing my hands."
2,23/4/2025 17:09,Two-handed rotation gesture,"I have more control with the two-handed rotation gesture, it feels more natural. But still feel limited In terms of flexibility upon rotation. I think more gesture such as moving the globe position when both hands are moving simultaneously following the centre of the hands."
3,24/4/2025 11:48,One-handed rotation gesture,"More fingers means more calorie burns. But it has limitation with the control, not sure how to solve or give gesture recommendation."
4,25/4/2025 11:55,One-handed rotation gesture,"I like one handed better because I have more control to rotate the orientations as I like, as for the gestures I ‘ll suggest maybe we can use hands like waving gestures to rotate the globe"
5,25/4/2025 19:49,I have no preference,Both options have their advantages. One hand is simple but little bit harder for complex task like rotation. I think it would be better if I can rotate our pump like rotating door knob
6,26/4/2025 9:51,One-handed rotation gesture,"I prefer one-handed gesture one because its easier to imagine the direction. However, the two-handed gesture will be useful in medical field. Especially in surgery."
7,26/4/2025 11:07,One-handed rotation gesture,I prefer one-handed gesture because it is handy and more flexible.
8,30/4/2025 16:29,Two-handed rotation gesture,"I prefer two handed because it gives more flexibility. However I feel that two handed takes time to adapt.  I think it would be better if we can touch and manipulate directly like aphysical globe. If the globe is far, we can use gaze and pinch to make it nearer, then we can use direct gesture manipulation."
9,30/4/2025 17:53,One-handed rotation gesture,I prefer one handed because it is simpler. 
10,1/5/2025 18:07,One-handed rotation gesture,I prefer one handed because it is easier to move the globe from any directions while the two handed it is more difficult because it takes two-hands coordination. Gaze and pinch is convinient enough.
11,2/5/2025 20:55,One-handed rotation gesture,"I prefer one handed because thats how I usually operate globe in real life. Unless the two handed uses palms like holding real globes, I’d prefer it."
12,6/5/2025 9:33,I have no preference,"1. It would be better if we have the option of using two hands, instead of directly using 2 hands. It gives the option of z axis adjustment in the middle of x,y axis rotation.
2. It would be better if we could rotate it with our palm like in iron man 2.
3. It would be confusing when you try to combine both rotation and position with the same gestures."

1,23/4/2025 16:15,"Maintain globe position: The position of the globe remains unchanged, irrespective of size adjustments","I prefer maintain globe position since it makes me easy to observe the globe closely and clearly, because I think the maintain distance one is not close enough and a bit blurry."
2,23/4/2025 17:17,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"For me personally I like to use the maintain distance to globe behaviour because its easier to see when observing the surface. But depends on the situation, if we are in a bigger room such as auditorium it will be more managable. But since in this I’m doing it in a small room, its easier to use the maintain distance to globe."
3,24/4/2025 11:57,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"For the scope of this globe experiment, I prefer “maintain distance…”, because I do not think it is necessary to go inside the globe which is empty. However, the zoom level for “maintain distance…” behaviour needs to be closer or have zoom level control, I.e, “Observing a very small island in the globe, like Bermuda island”"
4,25/4/2025 12:00,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"I like the 2nd options better so we can observe the globe more detail, without being worry about the globe disappear in front of us."
5,25/4/2025 19:58,"Maintain globe position: The position of the globe remains unchanged, irrespective of size adjustments","I prefer maintain globe position because the zoom level is larger, so I can easily observe the object"
6,26/4/2025 9:57,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"For specifically observing maps/globes, I prefer the maiaintain distance to globes one because, ithe maximum zoom level is enough for me to observe the surface of the globe. "
7,26/4/2025 11:12,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"I prefer the maintain distance to globe because it is easier to observe t, the zoom level of maintain distance to globe is good."
8,30/4/2025 16:39,I have no preference,Depends on the situation. I have no preference.  Maintain distance is confusing whether the gesture is broken or not at the maximum zoom point. But if the purpose is for observing the globe the maintain distance is better.

10,1/5/2025 18:14,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,I prefer the maintain distance because it is easier to observe the surface in a proper distance
11,2/5/2025 21:00,I have no preference,"It depends, for professionals like maybe government, if they want to observe details, it would better use maintain globe. But for casual users, they would not like the globe zoomed through their heads, they would like maintain distance better. So, I have no preference."
12,6/5/2025 9:42,Maintain distance to globe: The position of the globe moves while its size changes.,"1. It would be better if the limit of the zoom is very close (increase the limit) to our face or at least give the option to.
2. The DPI and the speed of scaling in and out need to be adjusted. It is more into the callibration of the hands gesture and the actual object. 
3. It is difficult to combine the zoom gestures and the rotation with two hands."
